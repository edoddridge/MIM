Benchmarking
************************

Aronnax runs in two different modes. These two modes have
substantially different runtimes due to the equations being solved.

These benchmarks are run on a single processor and can be reproduced by running the `benchmark.py` script in the `benchmarks/` directory.


Reduced gravity mode
========================
The reduced gravity mode is substantially faster than the n-layer mode.

   :alt: run time for reduced gravity mode

   Reduced-gravity runtime scaling with resolution.  These data are
   timings of different 500-step simulations of a Gaussian depth bump
   evolving in a :math:`\beta`-plane approximation to the Earth's
   curvature, with different resolutions.


n-layer mode
==========================
Because it requires a linear equation solve at every timestep, including the ocean
floor leads to substantially more expensive simulations.

   n-layer runtime scaling with resolution.  These data are
